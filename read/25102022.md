# Reading notes
- Time & Date in Go: https://golangbyexample.com/all-about-time-and-date-golang/
	- Golang, instead of using codes such as above, uses date and time format placeholders that look like date and time only. Go uses standard time, which is:
	```go
Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006  (MST is GMT-0700)
or 
01/02 03:04:05PM '06 -0700
```
	- So if you notice go uses	
		-   01 for day of the month ,
		-   02 for the month
		-   03 for hours ,
		-   04 for minutes
		-   05 for second
		-   and so on
- Slices in Go: https://nhannguyen.me/blog/understanding-slices-in-golang
	- Re-slicing a slice doesn’t make a copy of the underlying array. The full array will be kept in memory until it is no longer referenced. Occasionally this can cause the program to hold all the data in memory when only a small piece of it is needed.
	```go
func getData(limit int)[]interface{} {
    data = /*a very large data*/
    return data[:limit] 
    // the large array is still get referenced underline
}
```
	- To fix this problem we can copy the interesting data to a new slice before returning it:
	```go
func getData()[]interface{} {
    data = /*a very large data*/
    result := make([]interface{}, limit)
	copy(result, data)

    return result 
    // the large underlying array is released by the garbage collector
}
```
	- `copy` clone cả underlying array, chứ ko xài chung, nên khi copy qua thì `dest` slice và `src` slice sẽ không point tới cùng underlying array.
